This paper summarizes our work on servo control, code implementation on a microprocessor and analysis of the robustness to parameter uncertainty and sensor noise. The first and second part use the result from workshop A about how to control a DC-motor in position, improving the controller by using a model following block and a trajectory planner. The last part deals with closed loop poles positionning in the case of a valved controlled hydraulic cylinder.
